Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Jomkit, but everyone calls me James. I was born in Thailand but moved to the United States when I was a baby. I believe every problem has many solutions, so it's best to find the solution in your style.

I've always loved building legos, because I'm amazed at what complex art and functionality can be produced from small bits and pieces. There's a lesson there too, if you've ever stepped on a lego; the greatest pain can come from the tiniest missing detail. This is why I bring 110% to my projects, to ensure that my end-users never have to worry about hidden lego pieces.

Aside from programming, learning new languages and frameworks, I like to try out new things to broaden my perspective, and help me come up with new ideas. I also love reading books. Here are a few more of my hobbies:

### My story

I went to college for Electrical/Mechanical Engineering Technology, then I taught STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) to high-schoolers in Japan for a few years. While I was there I got a lot of exposure to programming, and realized my calling was making websites that were both visually-stunning and dynamically functional. I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering bootcamp with Springboard, where I've learn an incredible amount of technology.
